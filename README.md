To run the Instagram mass reporting script from the terminal, follow these steps:


Set Up Your Environment:

Ensure you have an Instagram Developer account to obtain necessary credentials (access token, client ID, etc.).

Store these credentials securely either in a .env file or within your Python script.



Install Required Packages:

If the script relies on external libraries like requests, install them using pip:

  `pip install requests`




Prepare Your Script:

Ensure your Python script is set up to handle authentication by including credentials (access token, client ID) and a list of usernames.

Replace placeholders in the script with  `actual credentials and username lists.`



Run the Script:

Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where your Python script is located.

Execute the script using:

 `python filename.py`


If the script imports modules from a specific package (e.g., instagram), use:

 `python -m instagram mass_report_instagram_users.py`




Handle Output:

Ensure logging is configured to write results to both console and log files for better tracking.



Monitor and Debug:

Check dependencies, authentication status, rate limits, and system resources during script execution.

Log errors and monitor the terminal output for any issues.
By following these steps, you can successfully run the Instagram mass reporting functionality as intended.
